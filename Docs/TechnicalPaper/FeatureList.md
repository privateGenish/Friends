### Exploring Core and Future Functionalities of Friends
>Friends offers a unique way for users to connect through group dynamics, facilitating safe and meaningful interactions. Core features include individual and group profiles, democratic matching, and versatile communication tools. Additional planned enhancements, like the Event-Based Search, will further allow users to connect based on shared event interests. This comprehensive feature set ensures Friends provides a flexible and engaging social platform for users looking to expand their social circles or find new friends for specific activities.

# Core Features

## 1. User Profiles and Group Formation

* Individual Profile Creation:
  * Users undergo a standard onboarding process that includes:
    * OTP (One-Time Password) verification to ensure authenticity.
    * Uploading a face picture and at least two additional photos.
    * Providing age information and a brief personal bio.
* Group Profile Creation:
  * A user can create a group by starting a group profile.
  * The group profile becomes active once at least one more member joins.
  * Both the creator and the new member(s) have equal editing and administrative permissions.
  * Group profiles include shared interests, group goals (e.g., dating, common hobbies), and member details.
* Profile Details:
  * Individual profiles include personal photos, age, and a bio.
  * Group profiles summarize the group’s purpose, interests, and member information.

## 2. Matching and Discovery

### Group Matching:
  * Groups can search and match with other groups based on:
    * Dating: For groups looking to explore romantic connections.
    * Common Interests: For groups centered around hobbies, activities, or social interests.
    * Meeting New Friends: For groups open to expanding their social circle without specific intent.
  * Groups can choose to explore freely or filter their searches based on these categories, aligned with their own classification.
### Democratic Matching:
  * Matching is based on a democratic process where at least half of the group members must “swipe right” (approve) for a match to occur.
  * If consensus isn’t reached, it counts as a conservative "left swipe" (no match).
  * Group members can leave comments on their individual swipes, providing insights into their preferences and reasons.
### Dynamic Discoverability:
  * The app uses a dynamic, predetermined radius to discover potential matches.
  * This radius is set by the app and adjusts based on user activity and location.
  * Individual swipes within a group influence visibility across group members’ discovery ranges.

## 3. Communication and Interaction

* In-Group Messaging:
  * Groups have a dedicated chat system for internal communication.
  * Members can discuss and plan activities or share insights about potential matches.
* Group-to-Group and Individual Messaging:
  * Once a match occurs, groups can initiate chats with matched groups.
  * Members can also choose to message individuals from the matched group directly.
  * This feature facilitates deeper connections and one-on-one interactions post-match.
